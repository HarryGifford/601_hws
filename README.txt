Directory structure
===================

Contains code for SVM, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks.

AE - Autoencoder code. Somewhat messy and probably not useful for use in a homework.

Kernels - Contains code to run Kernelized versions of LR or SVM. Both are trained using gradient methods (either SGD or L-BFGS).

LR - Logistic Regression code. Can be used to train and test a LR classifier (or SVM).

NN - Neural Network code.

data - contains some datasets used by the different classifiers.

shared - some helper functions used all over the code.
