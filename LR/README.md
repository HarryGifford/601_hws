== Directory structure:

costL2.m - L2 Regularization cost function. Used to add regularization to a cost function.

costLR.m - Logistic Regression cost function.

costSE.m - Squared error cost function.

costSVM.m - SVM cost function.

minimize.m - function applies gradient descent to the given cost function.

predictLR.m - predicts class labels for data given a trained model.

runDigits.m - script that trains and tests your logistic regression classifier against a subset of the MNIST dataset.

runLR.m - script that trains and tests your logistic regression classifier against some dataset. If no dataset is given it runs against a randomly generated 2D dataset and plots the decision boundary.

trainLR.m - trains the Logistic Regression classifier.
