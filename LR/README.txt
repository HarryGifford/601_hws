costLR - Logistic Regression cost function.

costSE - Squared error cost function.

costSVM - SVM cost function.

minimize - function applies gradient descent to the given cost function.

predictLR - predicts class labels for data given a trained model.

runDigits - script that trains and tests your logistic regression classifier against a subset of the MNIST dataset.

runLR - script that trains and tests your logistic regression classifier against some dataset. If no dataset is given it runs against a randomly generated 2D dataset and plots the decision boundary.
